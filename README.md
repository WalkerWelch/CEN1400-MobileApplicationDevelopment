This is my Finalized Course Project for my CEN1400 - Mobile Application Development class.
This project used jQuery through the use of HTML, CSS, and Java Script.
The Mobile App includes content for a list of my personal favorite movies. 
Here is a link to that finalized Course Project. http://sotd.us/walkerwelch/Module_06_CourseProject.html

The app design for the main page includes a panel at the top left in order to get additional information links.
The main page header includes "Walker Welch's Course Project and my logo at the top center.
The content sections of the main page include a listview link section to 8 different sections of the app site. 
These 8 sections include:
1. About Me
2. Grid Introduction to my Favorite Movies
3. Filtered List of my Favorite Movies
4. Movie 1: Speed Racer
5. Movie 2: 1917
6. Movie 3: Lord of the Rings: Return of the King
7. Survey Form
8. Thank You

Each link on the main page will take you to each sections content. There is built in buttons thanks to the jQuery UI to be able to go back to the main page of the mobile app.
Throughout the Grid Introduction and Filtered List pages of my app, there is also links to each page of my top 3 favorite movies.

Inside the Survey Form section of my mobile app, there are lots of good jQuery UI when filling out the form with dropdown options, buttons, input fields, as well as a reset and submit button at the bottom.
After the Survey Form is filled out, a Java Script event handler is triggered and a unique user response is submitted to the Thank You page of the mobile site.

The Theme of the Mobile App was helped created using ThemeRoller to create 3 swatches throughout the site.
